# Tests for the task:
## Multi-dimensional Array

### Transpose given matrix.
Three values ​​are given to the input of the function: 
- number of rows, 
- number of columns,
- matrix

___The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.___

Example:

    Input: 3, 3, a = {
                  {0, 1, 2}, 
                  {3, 4, 5}, 
                  {6, 7, 8}
            };

    Output: a = {
                  {0, 3, 6}, 
                  {1, 4, 7}, 
                  {2, 5, 8}
            };
